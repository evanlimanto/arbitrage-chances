# arbitrage-chances
Finding the best arbitrage opportunities for the top 100 cryptocurrencies.


`start [--pairs -p] [--exchanges -e] [--minimum_volume -m] [--simple -s] [--coins_shown -c]`

defaults:
+ `trading_pairs = ALL`
  + sets what trading pairs are accepted
+ `exchanges = ALL`
  + sets what exchanges are accepted
+ `minimum_volume = 1%`
  + sets minimum coin percent volume on exchange
+ `simple = False`
  + hides information and errors
+ `coins_shown = 10`
  + sets the number of coins shown

I usually run it with these settings:   
`python3 ./start --exchanges Binance Kucoin Etherdelta Cryptopia Bittrex Bitfinex Poloniex --pairs ETH BTC LTC`

if you made some money, tips and stars are appreciated and help further development.

|---|---|
|LTC |`LPCyB2yExbZdJUNRyNhhV8EYD7zU5MqrX7`|
|BTC |`1GNUsALbvyNwYVGSsX7LGRKFtgdnH6s3Rg`|
|ETH |`0x293a25bc3e1da86bb3322cf940e7baf49f52cae4`|

Note:
+ Arbitrage usually exists for a reason. Usually this is:
  + No wallet withdrawal / Deposit for a coin
  + High withdrawal fees or long wait time
  + Very low volume
  
At 25 stars, I will make an optimised go version for all to use - executable so it's easier to use.
